ryuujouji tries to figure out which portion a Japanese word's reading
belongs to which Kanji character. This will allow more granular
searching of words in dictionary applications (or any software that
searches for Japanese words) by being able to search for "words that
use this character AND this reading". The name ryuujouji (粒状字) comes
from this goal, and it means "granular characters".

This is experimental software and doesn't work for a large number of
cases. 

This project makes use of KANJIDIC2 and JMdict. Please see:
KANJIDIC2 page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/
JMdict page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict.html

The main project directory (./ryuujouji/) will aim to build a database
of solutions against the entries in JMdict. 

For use in other software, feel free to copy the portable directory
(./ryuujouji_portable/). Just import the function get_readings from
reading.py. The function is called with two arguments, the word and its
reading, and returns a list. The list contains lists of size 2. The
first element is the kanji, the second is the reading. See the test
function as an example.
