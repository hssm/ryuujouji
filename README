ryuujouji tries to figure out which portion a Japanese word's reading
belongs to which Kanji character. This will allow more granular
searching of words in dictionary applications (or any software that
searches for Japanese words) by being able to search for "words that
use this character AND this reading". The name ryuujouji (粒状字,
"granular characters") comes from this goal.

This is experimental software and doesn't guarantee any degree of
accuracy.

This project makes use of KANJIDIC2 and JMdict. Please see:
KANJIDIC2 page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/
JMdict page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict.html

The project builds a database of solutions against the entries in
JMdict. Currently, it finds a solution for 82% of the kanji/reading
pairs that exist in it. Many words don't have a solution, such as
those with gikun or jukujikun readings.
