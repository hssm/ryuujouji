ryuujouji (粒状字) -- granular characters.

Installation tools and usage instructions are forthcoming.

ryuujouji is a grapheme-phoneme aligner for the Japanese language.
That is, given a word and its reading, it tries to determine which
portion of the reading (the phoneme) belongs to which character in
the word (the grapheme). For example:

非常事態[ひじょうじたい]
非 ひ
常 じょう
事 じ
態 たい

日帰り[ひがえり]
日 ひ
帰 がえり

建て替える[タテカエル]
建 タテ
替 カエル

In addition to determining the alignment, the transformations
undertaken by each reading (from its original dictionary reading) are
tagged and stored in a database. The goal is to allow very granular
searching in dictionary or other word-search applications, such as
searching for words including a character *and* a specific reading of
it. The project was created with the intent of supplying 
Japanese-language learning software with the ability to find the most
"knowable" words from what is already known by a learner by grading
each unseen word based on the components that appear in it. The main
components are the character, the reading, the transformation(s) of the
reading, and its index in the word. Each of these components is refered
to as a "segment" of a word in this project.

Here is some example verbose output, showing the transformation tags
and indexes generated, as well as the original dictionary reading that
the segment was derived from:

包み紙[つつみがみ]
character[包] reading[つつみ] index[0] indexr[1] tags['Regular', 'OkuInflected'] dic_reading[つつ.む] reading_id[9783]
character[紙] reading[がみ] index[1] indexr[0] tags['Dakuten'] dic_reading[かみ] reading_id[4272]

守り人[もりびと]
character[守] reading[もり] index[0] indexr[1] tags['KanaTrail'] dic_reading[もり] reading_id[4658]
character[人] reading[びと] index[1] indexr[0] tags['Dakuten'] dic_reading[ひと] reading_id[5637]

Note that the indexes above (with indexr being the reverse index)
reflect the nth occurence of a kanji and ignores kana (both will be
available in the future).

Unlike existing research, ryuujouji does not employ any statistical
method to determine the alignment. All solutions are constructed using
data available in KANJIDIC2 and hand-crafted rules that account for
particular features of the Japanese language.

Accuracy is measured against a manually aligned test data set from
existing research that contains 5000 instances. Please see:
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/W/W99/W99-0902.pdf
The data set has its own license and can be found here:
http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/research/lt/resources/gpalignment/gpalignment.tgz

ryuujouji currently achieves 90.28% accuracy on this data set, but is
expected to increase in coming revisions. Also, ryuujouji is able to
build a solution for 92% of the unique word/reading entries in JMdict
(that's 147,129 out of 159,207 in the current test data), although
their accuracy can't be tested.

Note that many words don't have a solution, such as
those with gikun or jukujikun readings.
